SEM basis

Convert poly permute monomial
Fast basis change
Fix subs 

Change vars breaks if not positive

Test if Poly technique is faster
Results: higher degree and/or fewer terms, poly faster

Use symengine for everything possible
Basis instead of generating set
classical schubpoly
basis generates basis change

schubpoly_quantum is slow

more tests

subs faster, do better with dense product

Key union?

sum of dicts

Decouple from sympy
Don't load args

Zero things out

Reduce adds and muls

Algebrize parabolic
(use composition instead of explicit parabolic)
