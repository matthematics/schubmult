# schubmult

## Program and package for rapid computation of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients of Schubert polynomials, compliant with sympy and with optional Sage integration

The main purpose of this python package is for executing scripts to compute coefficients of products of 
various types of Schubert polynomials. Coproducts can also be computed, as well as substitution of 
commuting difference operators for quantum double Schubert polynomials. Quantum multiplication also has 
parabolic subgroup support, computed via the Peterson-Woodward comparison theorem. **Note that except 
for quantum Schubert polynomial multiplication with the --basic-pieri option, the methodology for 
quantum/quantum double Schubert polynomials is conjectural at this time.**
