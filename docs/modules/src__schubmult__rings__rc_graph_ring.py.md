## class RCGraphPrintingTerm(TypedPrintingTerm)



## class RCGraphRingElement(CrystalGraphRingElement)

RCGraphRing elements are linear combinations of RCGraph basis elements.
This class implements crystal operations by linear extension: for each
basis RCGraph in the support apply the RCGraph operation and collect
the results into a new ring element.
